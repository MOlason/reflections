How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    The FC function was actually more helpful as it showed me only the changes made. By isolating the changes, it was easier to identify a mistake.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Because you can easily attack and solve the errors n  your code.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Because you can control how many changes are in each commit or group changes together in commits. However you have to remember to do it.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because Git is used by programmers and they tend to want to keep related files and related changes togetehr.
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Git log shows you all of the changes made, while git diff shows you the differences between two files.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Because I'll always know that I can come back to a previous version if something goes wrong
    
Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Upload my project to Github
